# 🎬 DVD Rental Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the DVD Rental sample database (PostgreSQL) to uncover insights about customer behavior, revenue trends, staff performance, and film popularity. The dataset is a popular sample provided for practicing SQL and BI tools.

Using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization, we answer key business questions that a rental company might ask to improve operations and maximize revenue.

### Objectives
-Identify the top customers and their contribution to revenue
-Discover the most rented films and popular categories
-Track monthly revenue trends and seasonality
-Compare store performance and staff revenue contributions
-Analyze rental patterns (by hour and day of week)
-Evaluate customer activity (active vs inactive)
-Assess actor and film performance
