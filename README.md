# 🎬 DVD Rental Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the DVD Rental sample database (PostgreSQL) to uncover insights about customer behavior, revenue trends, staff performance, and film popularity. The dataset is a popular sample provided for practicing SQL and BI tools.

Using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization, we answer key business questions that a rental company might ask to improve operations and maximize revenue.

### Objectives

* Identify the top customers and their contribution to revenue
* Discover the most rented films and popular categories
* Track monthly revenue trends and seasonality
* Compare store performance and staff revenue contributions
* Analyze rental patterns (by hour and day of week)
* Evaluate customer activity (active vs inactive)
* Assess actor and film performance

### Tech Stack

* Database: PostgreSQL
* Query Language: SQL
* Visualization: Power BI
* Version Control: Git & GitHub

### Key Insights

* Certain film categories (like Action and Comedy) contribute the most to revenue
* The top 10 customers generate a significant share of total payments
* Rental activity peaks during specific evening hours
* The busiest rental days are typically weekends
* Monthly revenue trends show seasonality and business fluctuations
* Some actors appear in highly rented films, driving higher revenues
* The majority of customers are active, but a smaller group is inactive (potential churn risk)
* Store and staff performance varies, with some stores/staff generating higher revenue than others
