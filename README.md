# DVD Rental Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the DVD Rental sample database (PostgreSQL) to uncover insights about customer behavior, revenue trends, staff performance, and film popularity. The dataset is a popular sample provided for practicing SQL and BI tools.

Using SQL for querying and Power BI for visualization, we answer key business questions that a rental company might ask to improve operations and maximize revenue.
